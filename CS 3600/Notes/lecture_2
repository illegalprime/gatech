# Agents as Functions

Agents can be viewed as a function taking inputs from sensors
and producing outputs to actuators.

Agent <-> Environment (through sensor input and actuator output)

Agents do a thing and try to maximize their performance in doing that
thing. Some factors:
    - time to completeion
    - is it done correctly (sensors to check)
    - resources used
