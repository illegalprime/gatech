\section*{Environment Types}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fully or Partially Observable
    \item Deterministic of Stochastic
    \item Episodic or Sequential
    \item Static or Dynamic
    \item Discrete or Continuous
    \item Single-Agent or Multi-Agent
\end{itemize}

\section*{Agent Program Design}
We want to map the state to an action, should we just build a big table? Probably not, that's huge.

\paragraph{Types of Agents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflex
    \item Model-Based Agent
    \item Goal-Based Agent
    \item Utility-Based Agent
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reflex Agent}
This agent asks what is the world like now? Then what action should I take (based on some table/rules/algo).

\subsection*{Model-Based Agent}
A model of the environment is being kept in memory.

\subsection*{Goal-Based Agent}
Action not only dependent on state history, here you add planning and prediction of state.

\subsection*{Utility-Based Agent}
Not only need to get to a goal but this agent also tries to maximize a utility function.
